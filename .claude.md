# Linear CLI Integration

This project provides a Linear CLI tool for managing Linear tickets, issues, and teams.

## When to Use the Linear CLI

When the user asks about Linear tickets, issues, teams, or projects, use the `./linear` command via the Bash tool.

**Always use the `--json` flag** when programmatically reading Linear data to ensure consistent, parseable output.

## Available Commands

### Issue Management

- `./linear issue list --json` - List all issues
- `./linear issue view <issue-id> --json` - View details for a specific issue (e.g., `./linear issue view TEAM-123 --json`)
- `./linear issue create --json` - Create a new issue (interactive or with flags)

### Team Management

- `./linear team list --json` - List all teams

### Authentication

- `./linear auth login` - Authenticate with Linear API key
- Users can also set `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Get details about a specific issue
./linear issue view TEAM-123 --json

# List all issues
./linear issue list --json

# List all teams
./linear team list --json
```

## Notes

- The CLI is built for both human and Claude Code workflows
- JSON output makes it easy to parse and extract specific information
- Issue IDs follow the format: `TEAM-NUMBER` (e.g., `ENG-42`, `DESIGN-10`)
